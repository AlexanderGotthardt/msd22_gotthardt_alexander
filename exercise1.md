## Mildly interesting facts about orange cats

Orange cats are often referred to as "marmalade cats" or "ginger cats" due to their distinctive orange fur.

Male orange cats are more common than female orange cats, as the gene responsible for orange fur is linked to the X chromosome. Males only have one X chromosome, while females have two.

Some people believe that orange cats are more sociable and outgoing than other cats. This may be due to their unique fur color, which might make them more approachable and noticeable to humans.

There are many famous orange cats in American popular culture, including Garfield, Heathcliff, and Hobbes (from Calvin and Hobbes). These cats have become beloved icons in their own right, and have captured the hearts of millions of fans around the world. They have also helped to popularize the idea of the "orange cat" as a fun and charismatic member of the animal kingdom.
